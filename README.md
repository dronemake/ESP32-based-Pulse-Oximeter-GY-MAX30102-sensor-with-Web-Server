# ESP32-based-Pulse-Oximeter-GY-MAX30102-sensor-with-Web-Server
This project involves building a pulse oximeter using the MAX30100 sensor and an ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 hosts a web server that displays heart rate and SpO2 (oxygen saturation) readings in real time.


## Project Objectives:
To measure heart rate and SpO2 levels using the MAX30100 sensor.
To host a web server on the ESP32 that displays the sensor readings in real time.
To make the project portable and accessible via a Wi-Fi connection


## Hardware Components:


ESP32 Development Board
MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor
Connecting Wires
Breadboard or PCB
Power Supply
